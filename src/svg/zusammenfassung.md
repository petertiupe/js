# Summary
- D3 is the tool of choice when you want to have total creative and technical freedom with your data visualizations.
- D3 applications are styled and served like traditional web content.
- D3 is never used alone but is rather part of an ecosystem of technologies and tools that we combine to create rich web interfaces: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG, Canvas, and frameworks such as React or Svelte.
- The SVG shapes that we use most often as we build data visualizations are lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, paths, and text.
You need a basic understanding of these shapes and their main attributes to work with D3.
- Before working with D3, you should familiarize yourself with two JavaScript subjects—method chaining and object manipulation:
### Method chaining and Object-Manipulation 
- is a pattern where multiple methods are called one after the other on the same object.
- In D3, datasets are often structured as arrays of objects. JavaScript offers multiple methods to access and manipulate the data within these structures.
- As a D3 developer, it’s important to develop a solid understanding of data visualization best practices. Multiple resources can help you start your learning journey.
